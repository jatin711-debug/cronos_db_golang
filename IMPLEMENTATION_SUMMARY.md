# CronosDB Implementation Summary

## Overview

CronosDB is a distributed, timestamp-triggered database with built-in scheduling, pub/sub messaging, and WAL-based persistence. This document summarizes the complete implementation.

## Architecture Components

### 1. **High-Level Architecture**
- See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for full system design
- Components: Clients → API Gateway → Partition Nodes → (WAL + Scheduler + Delivery + Dedup)
- Communication: gRPC-based
- Consistency: Eventually consistent for data, Raft for metadata

### 2. **Protobuf Schema** ✅
**File:** `proto/events.proto`

Complete gRPC API including:
- `Event` - Core event structure with message_id, schedule_ts, payload, topic, meta
- `Publish`/`PublishResponse` - Event publishing with deduplication
- `Subscribe`/`Delivery`/`Ack` - Streaming subscriptions with at-least-once delivery
- `ReplayRequest`/`ReplayEvent` - Time-range and offset-based replay
- `ConsumerGroupService` - Consumer group management
- `ReplicationService` - Leader-follower replication
- `PartitionService` - Partition administration

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. **Consistent Hashing vs Static Partitioning**
- Implemented: Static partition assignment per topic
- Future: Consistent hashing for automatic partition distribution

### 2. **Raft for Metadata, Custom for WAL**
- Metadata (partition ownership, consumer groups) → Raft consensus
- WAL replication → Custom async protocol (lower latency)
- Tradeoff: Simpler data plane, strong consistency where needed

### 3. **PebbleDB for State Stores**
- Dedup store: PebbleDB (LSM tree, good performance)
- Consumer offsets: PebbleDB
- Choice: Battle-tested in CockroachDB, excellent Go support

### 4. **Timing Wheel with Absolute Time**
- Hierarchical wheels for scalability
- **Key Fix:** Timer stores absolute `ExpirationMs` (Unix timestamp in ms)
- Each wheel level calculates its own delay from absolute time
- Prevents timing drift when events cascade through overflow wheels
- O(1) timer insertion and expiration
- Persistent checkpoints for crash recovery

### 5. **At-Least-Once Delivery with DLQ**
- Guarantees: Every event delivered ≥1 times
- Duplicates handled by dedup store
- Ack-based offset commits
- **Dead Letter Queue** captures events that fail after max retries
- Industry-standard approach

### 6. **Timer ID Format for Duplicate Support**
- Timer ID: `message_id-offset` (e.g., "msg-123-42")
- Allows same message_id to be scheduled multiple times with AllowDuplicate=true
- Each event gets unique timer in the timing wheel
